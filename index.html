<br/>

<a href="chat3.rbw">Single File Download</a> - This is probably what you want
if you're looking to get started using chat.  This program is all you need
to connect to the best extensible encrypted Ruby one-off chat program in
eastern North-America.
<br/><br/>

<a href="http://github.com/kedji/chat3">Browse the Source</a> - Or join in
the development.  Chat 3.0 is hosted on github, so grabbing or perusing the
source code couldn't be easier.
<br/><br/>

<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Download Ruby</a> - If
you're running Windows, you probably want the "Ruby on Windows One-Click
Installer".  Chat 3.0 works out of the box on Windows Ruby.  If you're running
Mac OS-X or Linux, you probably already have Ruby installed.
<br/><br/>

<a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=300&release_id=41247">FXRuby Gem</a>
- For you Mac and Linux folks, you'll probably need to install the FXRuby gem
to use Chat 3.0.  You'll want the latest appropriate gem, which is
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/66842/fxruby-1.6.20.gem">
fxruby-1.6.20.gem</a> at the time of this writing.  Keep in mind you will
need to install the appropriate Fox toolkit packages first.  For example, on
Debian/Ubuntu systems:
<br/><br/>
<b>sudo apt-get install libfox-1.6-dev<br/>
sudo gem install fxruby-1.6.20.gem</b><br/>
